Even then I could hardly reach 15 FPS and I dreamt of installing thoses so &quot;shaders&quot; I kept hearing about that turned the pixelized game in a shiny and glittering experience. When I tried installing them, my game turned into a litteral slideshow... but it was so darn pretty!</p><p><a href="minecraft_shader.png"></a></p><p>A few years later when I was learning blender I heard about shaders again, for the first time outside of Minecraft. I played around in the shader graph - Blender's no code shader system - but learning to write shaders by hand seemed like a daunting task. It turns out &quot;shaders&quot; are not only limited to minecraft but are basically in every video game you ever played, from texturing the trees, from making the ocean waves rise and collapse realistically.</p><p>Fast forward to a few weeks ago when I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4s1h2YETNY">a video by Kishimisu</a> on shader coding and I was floored with how much you could do with what is essentially just a big formula for every pixel. In this way shader coding (in this case GLSL - OpenGL Shader Language) is the intersection of math, art and programming I never knew I wanted. The possibilities are pretty much endless and it is a fantastic way to learn and apply new math concepts.</p><p>But beyond the technical aspects, it's the community that really stuck with me. The tutorial made use of the website <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">shadertoy</a> and exploring it blew my mind to pieces. The demos people were coming up with were unbelievable: from <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/lcXSDM">animations</a>, <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/llXfRr">fractals</a>, <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ssjyWc">2D</a>, <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XcXXzS">3D</a> and even <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WtB3Wt">4D</a>. Some people push the technique to it's limit by creating complex scenes with <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/DlySDD">only a few lines of code</a> or <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/msVXWD">integrate full on machine learning models</a>.</p><p>The code for every shader is open and you can really simply start changing variables or fork it to make your own version. Most often than not, the creator leaves behind a few comments so you can try to understand how its made. Every art piece is also an opportunity to learn something new.</p><p>What I find most interesting about this small online niche is that there is not that many people active on the site. After a while you start recognizing names and you van even guess who wrote what shader only by looking at it. It's a community of passionate people that are contributing to the website only for the sake of technical achievement and bragging rights. There is no recommendation algorithm, no ads and no way to make money. The feeling of community around this obscure art form is refreshing, I don't know anything about theses people but in a way I feel like I get to know them from how they express themselves through this obscure language.</p><p>For now I still didn't create a lot of shaders on there but I wanted to take the time to write about my new found obsession. If you want to take a look at my small creations you can find my <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/user/retronyme">profile here</a>. If you never picked up shader coding I'm convinced shadertoy is a great way to start toying around and be part of a supportive community!</p></div></article></main><footer class="mt-20 px-10 py-8 bg-slate-200"><div class="max-w-5xl mx-auto text-slate-700 text-center">Â© 2023 <a href="/blog/" class="font-medium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruben Gres</a>.</div></footer><script src="/blog/assets/js/bundle.js"></script></body></html>
