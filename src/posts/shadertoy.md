When I was in middle school I played minecraft on an old family pc with the lowest possible settings. Even then I could hardly reach 15 FPS and I dreamt of installing thoses "shaders" I kept hearing about that turned the pixelized game in a shiny and glittering experience. Needless to say when I tried installing it it turned my game into a litteral slideshow...  but the game was so darn pretty!

A few years later when I was learning blender I heard about shaders for the first time outside of minecraft. I played around with them in the shader graph - Blender's no code shader system - but learning to write shaders manually always scared me because it seemed so hard to get into.  

A few weeks ago I've stumbled upon [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4s1h2YETNY) on shader coding and I was floored with how much you could do with what is essentially just a big formula math for every pixel. Exploring through shadertoy blew my minds and the demos the community were comming up to were unbelievable. From animations, fractals, 2D, 3D and even 4D...

Shader code (in this case GLSL - OpenGL Shader Language) is the intersection of math, art and programming I never knew I needed. The possibilities are pretty much endless and it is a fantastic way to learn and apply new math concepts.

On shadertoy the community is so small taht there is only a handful of new shader taht are posted every day and you can quickly get like and comments from active members of the site. The feeling of community around this obscure art form is refreshing, it feels like home. Far from the inpersonal nature of our usual interactions online. Here everything is open and you can learn from what you see.

For now I still didn't create a lot of shaders on shadertoy but I wanted to take the time to write about my new found obsession. If you never picked up shader coding I think shadertoy is a great way to start. Please give it a try!
